NAME
    File::PM2File - obsolete. User File::Where

SYNOPSIS
     file_in_include()  # obsolete. Replace with File::Where::where()
     pm2file()          # obsolete. Replace with  File::Where::where_pm()
     pm2require()       # obsolete. Replace with  File::Where::pm2require()

     $File::PM2File::warn_obsolete = 1;  # turns on obsolete warning

REQUIREMENTS
    The File::PM2File subrouitnes shall not used.

    The File::PM2File subroutines shall be replaced by the appropriate
    File::Where subroutine whenever a File::PM2File subroutine needs
    revision as follows:

     File::PM2File::find_in_include()   File::Where::where()
     File::PM2File::pm2file             File::Where::where_pm()
     File::PM2File::pm2require          File::Where::pm2require

    NOTE: The subroutine File::Where::where is almost a direct drop in for
    File::PM2File::find_in_include(). The difference is in an array context
    File::Where::where() returns a third item where
    File::PM2File::find_in_include() only returns two. The first two items,
    though, are the same.

DEMONSTRATION
     ~~~~~~ Demonstration overview ~~~~~

    Perl code begins with the prompt

     =>

    The selected results from executing the Perl Code follow on the next
    lines. For example,

     => 2 + 2
     4

     ~~~~~~ The demonstration follows ~~~~~

  3.3 Changes
    Changes are as follows:

    Test-TestUtil-0.01
        Originated

    Test-TestUtil-0.02
        Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse"
        <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de> test run

        t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil....Bareword "fspec_dirs" not allowed while
        "strict subs" in use at

          /net/sunu991/disc1/.cpanplus/5.8.0/build/Test-TestUtil-0.01/blib/lib/Test/TestUtil.pm line 56.

        Changed line 56 from

         my @dirs = (fspec_dirs) ? $from_package->splitdir( $fspec_dirs ) : ();

        to

         my @dirs = ($fspec_dirs) ? $from_package->splitdir( $fspec_dirs ) : ();

        This error is troublesome since the test passed on my system using
        Active Perl under Microsoft NT. It should never have passed. This
        error is in a core method, *fspec2fspec*, that changes file
        specifications from one operating system to another operating
        system. This method has been in service unchanged for some time.

    Test-TestUtil-0.03
        Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse"
        <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de> test run

        PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /usr/local/perl/bin/perl "-MExtUtils::Command::MM"
        "-e" "test_harness(0, 'blib/lib', 'blib/arch')"
        t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil....# Test 18
        got: '$VAR1 = ''; ' (t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t at line 540 fail
        #17) # Expected: '$VAR1 = '\\=head1 Title Page

        The *pm2datah* method is not returning any data for Test 18. This
        will also cause the test of *pm2data*, test 19 to fail. The
        *pm2datah* is searching for the string "\n__DATA__\n".

        The "\n" character on Perl is a logical end of line character
        sequence. The "\n" end of line is different on Mr. Smokehouse's Unix
        operating system than on my Windows NT operating system. The test
        file was created under MSWin32 and uses a MSWin32 "\n". Under UNIX,
        *pm2datah* method will look for the Unix "\n" and there will not be
        any.

        Changed "\n__DATA__\n" to /[\012\015]__DATA__/.

        During the clean-up for CPAN, broke the *format_hash_table* method
        for tables in hash of hash format. Fixed the break, added test 29 to
        the *t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t* test script for this feature, and
        added a discusssion of this feature in POD discription for
        *format_hash_table*

    Test-TestUtil-0.04
        item our old friend visits again - DOS and UNIX text file
        incompatibility

        This impacts other modules. We have to examine all modules for this
        portability defect and correct any found defects.

        Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse"
        <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de> and Kingpin
        <mthurn@carbon> test runs.

        On Mr. Smokehouse's run email the got: VAR1 clearly showed extra
        white space line that is not present in the expected: VAR1. In Mr.
        Kingpin's run the got: VAR1 and expected: VAR1 look visually the
        same. However, the Unix found a difference(s) and failed the test.

        For Mr. Smokehouse's run:

        PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /usr/local/bin/perl "-MExtUtils::Command::MM" "-e"
        "test_harness(0, 'blib/lib', 'blib/arch')"

         Revision: G

        [snip]

         Software Version Description

         for

          File::PM2File - Convert PM specifications to file specifications

        What we have before, was a totally "failure to communicate." aka
        Cool Hand Luke. VAR1 was empty. Now VAR1 has something. It is not
        completely dead. One probable cause is the Unix operating system
        must be producing two Unix \012 new lines for a Microsoft single
        newline \015\012. Without being able to examine the test with a
        debugger, the only way to verify this is to provide the fix and see
        if the problem goes away when this great group of testers try for
        the fourth time.

        Revised *fin* method to take a handle, change *pm2datah* method
        handle, *$fh*, to binary by adding a *binmode $fh* statement, and
        pass the actual thru the *fin* method for test 18.

        Use *fin($fh)* to read in the data for *pm2data*, test 19 Unit Under
        Test (UUT), instead of using the raw file handle.

        The *fin* method takes any \015\012 combination and changes it into
        the logical Perl new line, *"\n"*, for the current operating system.

        *   At 02:44 AM 6/14/2003 +0200, Max Maischein wrote: A second thing
            that I would like you to reconsider is the naming of
            "Test::TestUtil" respectively "Test::Tech" - neither of those is
            descriptive of what the routines actually do or what the module
            implements. I would recommend renaming them to something closer
            to your other modules, maybe "Test::SVDMaker::Util" and
            "Test::SVDMaker::Tech", as some routines do not seem to be
            specific to the Test::-suite but rather general
            (format_array_table). Some parts (the "scrub" routines) might
            even better live in another module namespace,
            "Test::Util::ScrubData" or something like that.

            Broke away all the file related methods from Test::TestUtil and
            created this module File::FileUtil so the module name is more
            descriptive of the methods within the module.

        *   Broke the smart nl code out of the fin method and made it is own
            separate method, smart_nl method.

            At 02:44 AM 6/14/2003 +0200, Max Maischein wrote: Perl, as Perl
            already does smart newline handling, (even though with the
            advent of 5.8 even Unix-people have to learn the word "binmode"
            now :-))

            The only place where I see Perl does smart newline handling is
            the crlf IO displine introduce in Perl 5.6. The File::FileUtil
            has a use 5.001 so that 5.6 Perl built-ins cannot be used. Added
            comment to smart_nl that for users with 5.6 Perl that it may be
            better to use the built-in crlf IO discipline.

        *   For the load_package method that uses a eval "require $package"
            to load the package, the $@ does not capture all the warnings
            and error messages, at least not with ActiveState Perl. Added
            code the captures also the warnings, by temporaily reassigning
            $SIG(__WARN__), and added these to the $@ error messages.

        *   Added two new tests to verify the NOGO paths for the for the
            load_package method. One tests for load module failure looking
            for all the possilbe information on why the module did not load.
            The other verifies that the vocabulary is present after the
            loading the module. This information is very helpful when you
            must remote debug a load failure from CPAN testing whose is
            running on a different platform.

    File-FileUtil-0.02
        Added the method *hex_dump*.

    File-FileUtil-0.03

        test_lib2inc
            Returns to parent directory of the first t directory going up
            from the test script instead of the t directory.

        find_t_roots
            Added the function find_t_roots that returns the parent
            directory of all the directories in @INC

    File-PM2File-0.01
        Removed the methods for converting a program module specification to
        its absolute file from the "File::FileUtil" module to their own
        module "File::PM2File" module. The module name is now more
        descriptive of the routines in the module.

    File-PM2File-0.02
        Changed prerequisite from "Test::STD::Scrub" to "Text::Scrub". This
        was a change to make the name more descriptive of the contents of
        the program module.

    File-PM2File-0.03
        Added 1 to the end of File::PM2File

    File-PM2File-0.04
        Added SelfLoader to File::PM2File

        Change test so that test support files resides in distribution
        directory tlib. Test support files not longer need be in the lib
        directory. The test support files in tlib will vanish after the
        installtion.

    File-PM2File-0.05
        Added subroutine interfaces.

        Use Archive::TarGzip that uses modd 777 for directories instead of
        666. Started to get emails from Unix about untar not being able to
        change to a directory with mod of 666.

    File-PM2File-0.06
        Added the 'Data-Secs2' to the 'tlib' test library. Upgraded to the
        'Test-Tech' module that uses the 'Data-Secs2' module.

    File-PM2File-0.07
        Obsoleted and superceded by the File::Where program module. All the
        subroutines now use functions from the File::Where program module.
        Changing over to File::Where subroutines will provide a micro
        increase in performance by eliminating a layer of subroutine calls.

        The lastest build of Test::STDmaker expects the test library in the
        same directory as the test script. Coordiated with the lastest
        Test::STDmaker by moving the test library from tlib to t/File, the
        same directory as the test script and deleting the test library
        File::TestPath program module.

         Summary of my perl5 (revision 5.0 version 8 subversion 0) configuration:
           Platform:
             osname=linux, osvers=2.4.22-4tr, archname=i586-linux

        This is capitalization problem. The program module name is 'FindBin'
        not 'FindBIN' which is part of Perl. Microsoft does not care about
        capitalization differences while linux does. This error is in the
        test script automatically generated by "Test::STDmaker" and was just
        introduced when moved test script libraries from "tlib" to the
        directory of the test script. Repaired "Test::STDmaker" and
        regenerated the distribution.

  3.7 Possible problems and known errors
    There is still much work needed to ensure the quality of this module as
    follows:

    *   State the functional requirements for each method including not only
        the GO paths but also what to expect for the NOGO paths

    *   All the tests are GO path tests. Should add NOGO tests.

    *   Add the requirements addressed as *# R: * comment to the tests

    *   Write a program to build a matrix to trace test step to the
        requirements and vice versa by parsing the *# R: * comments.
        Automatically insert the matrix in the module POD.
